- for spreadsheet: also add the sasha drink keywords into the drink names
ーTODO: fix the "dangerous" data!! everywhere where you have to ask something. 


-ASK 静 about サングリア prices?? like why are they more expensive, i think outside it also says something about 500yen?? like what xd
- ASK about the Champagne prices. what is the~~~~~~ ????

when displaying the names in the pricing list you want them to have interchanging different background colors to easier process the data. 

buttons: （今週の）おすすめ、限定パスタ

- ADD Lunch prices to menu items that also dont have changing price but simply appear on the lunch menu. 
- Ask 静 to review the data when she has time. 

- add way to add all to like a shopping list and then calculate the price automatically???? idk yet. this can go wrong. 


wine menu button ワイン表示 but also just write multiple prices
