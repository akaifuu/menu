Recipe book: 
- read through all the reciples  & add to spreadsheet the things you dont understand and also try to just have a barebones understanding of each recipe + figure out plating data 
- Add all Plate data (serving + serving prep)
- With Moe go through menu and understand what items are needed for each dish (torizara, knife, what plate etc Like it's basically 仕上げ++) 
Ask next time  ob wir in Pause durch recipe book durchgehen können (mistakes correcting etc). Vor allem was das ganze Zeug (Worte) bedeutet. Und ob wir das einfach durchgehen können 
- Add all the different cuts for things (have them in the recipe book): bacon cut, basil cut etc.? also the plates for serving
z.b. 大葉 is 2mm cut
