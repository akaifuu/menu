48 what about the fruits: each 35g?? total??


 recipe book & steps (at least the menu items i know +++ 仕上げ！！& plate data (have a fun visual for plate data)
 (recipeItems)

 add copy button to copy all the text. 

Check ob ich die ganzen りゃく übernommen habe & zeig die auch beim 表示 fenster!

Alternating colors for the recipe book items 

In the 値段 tab it should display the りゃく for each item!!!!!! Before the item.. Like a tag??... figure this out. 
When you open up the 値段 tab it should focus the input field!!!

Implement a changelog feature where I write what I changed w a timestamp of last update. Any way to automate this?

- for spreadsheet: also add the sasha drink keywords into the drink names

Implement changelog feature at top right 
MAKE FONT SMALLER FOR PHONES & the price design page has to be optimized for mobile! Better button placements, remove the title at top etc. 


ーTODO: fix the "dangerous" data!! everywhere where you have to ask something. 


-ASK 静 about サングリア prices?? like why are they more expensive, i think outside it also says something about 500yen?? like what xd
- ASK about the Champagne prices. what is the~~~~~~ ????

when displaying the names in the pricing list you want them to have interchanging different background colors to easier process the data. 

buttons: （今週の）おすすめ、限定パスタ

- ADD Lunch prices to menu items that also dont have changing price but simply appear on the lunch menu. 
- Ask 静 to review the data when she has time. 

- add way to add all to like a shopping list and then calculate the price automatically???? idk yet. this can go wrong. 


wine menu button ワイン表示 but also just write multiple prices
